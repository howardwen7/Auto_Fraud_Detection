# Auto Fraud Detection
## Project Background
According to one statistic, an estimate of more than 10% of all property/casualty insurance claims may be fraudulent. \
When these cases go undetected, insurance companies have to pass down excess losses as increased premiums for consumers. \
Even though comprehensive investigation can be implemented for each claim to identify fraud, it is a manual process that costs a lot and also result in longer processing times. 

## Project Goals
Our goal is to predict whether a given claim with vehicle and demographic characteristics is fraudulent or not. \
We are also interested in identifying features important in predicting frauds.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of ~18000 claims and 23 features. The target is binary yes/no fraudulent.
